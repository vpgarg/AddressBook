Swagger UI - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Please Note -
* Currently, H2 in-memory database is used to hold the contacts in the address book. This can be changed to store the data in persisted DB by updating the configuration.
* For testing, there will be 5 contacts loaded in the Database during the application start up.
* The current implementation can be enhanced further to store multiple address, phone number and email for a given contact person.
