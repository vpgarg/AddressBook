#### Address Book #####

## Installation

* "./mvnw clean install" to install maven dependencies and build the package
* "./mvnw spring-boot:run" to run Address Book application

## Getting Started

### See available REST endpoints using Swagger UI

Swagger UI - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Please Note -
* Currently, H2 in-memory database is used to hold the contacts in the address book. This can be changed to store the data in persisted DB by updating the configuration.
* For testing, there will be 5 contacts loaded in the in-memory database during the application start up.
* The H2 in-memory database can be accessed via web console "http://localhost:8080/h2-console/"
    -> Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
    -> JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    -> Username: sa
    -> Password: <Keep it blank>
* The current implementation can be enhanced further to store multiple address, phone number and email for a given contact person.
